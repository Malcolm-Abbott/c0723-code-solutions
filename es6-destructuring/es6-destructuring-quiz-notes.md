# es6-destructuring-quiz-notes

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?

Taking elements within a data type and assigning them to variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?

const {property1: variable1, property2: variable2} = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?

const [indexItem1, indexItem2, indexItem3] = array;

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?

The identifier for the object/array literal will be on the right hand side of the assignment operator and the object property identifiers / array index element identifiers will be on the left hand side of the assignment operator.
