- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

Every time the loop goes through (iterates over) the data type.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

Before the code block is executed.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

When you enter the loop, at the beginning before evaluating the conditional expression or the final expression.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

Before each loop iteration.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

After the body is ran, each iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

the break keyword.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

adds 1 to the value of the element each iteration.
